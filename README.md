# [Terminal Portfolio](https://term.ofcljaved.com)

A keyboard-driven experience for those who vibe with the CLI life.

As a Neovim enthusiast, I built this to reflect my world—type commands, explore my projects, blogs, and more, all without touching a mouse (because who needs one in Neovim?).

Styled with the sleek Rose Pine theme, it’s a minimalist, interactive twist on the classic portfolio.

Dive in, run some commands, and get a taste of what I’m about.

## Features

- Autocomplete feature  (TAB | Ctrl + i)
