    Hey, Iâ€™m Javed! ðŸ‘‹
    <br />
    Iâ€™m a software developer who loves crafting optimized frontend experiences with minimal librariesâ€”less is more. Lately, Iâ€™m diving into backend dev with the same vibe.
    <br />
    After my degree, I jumped into a job working closely with customers who use my product. Itâ€™s eye-openingâ€”they just want a slick UX, not tech jargon. Now, Iâ€™m itching for a switch, hunting for a new gig to shake things up.
    <br />
    Iâ€™m all-in on Neovim (bye, VS Code), playing with Lua for configs, Rust for Web3 kicks, and Go to chill out. New techâ€™s my thrill, and Iâ€™m leveling up my coding love before AI takes over. Until then, Iâ€™m building and optimizing!
  </p>;
